The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

### Motivation
- First, download and unzip the data file.
- Second, define the path where unzip data has been stored.
- Third, read in datasets.
- Finally, merge datasets by using rbind() %>% extract only measurements on mean and std by using regular expression %>% use dplyr to  generate tidy data file.


#### 1. Create directory and download the dataset

- This script create directory to store `UCI HAR Dataset`.

``` R
if (!file.exists("data")){
        dir.create("data")
}
```

- This script download data for project.
download.file(url,destfile = "./data/dat.zip", mode = "wb")

- This script unzip downloaded zip file.

``` R
unzip(zipfile = "./data/dat.zip", exdir = "./data")
```

#### 2. Merge train and test datasets to get one dataset

- This scripts read in require data and store in variables.

``` R
X_train <- read.table(file.path(datapath, "train","X_train.txt"), header=FALSE)
X_test <- read.table(file.path(datapath, "test", "X_test.txt"), header=FALSE)
```

- This scripts merge datasets by using rbind function.

``` R
X_total <- rbind(X_train,   X_test )
y_total <- rbind(y_train, y_test)
sub_total <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test ) 
```
#### 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

- This script extract only measurements on mean and standard deviation using regular expression. 

``` R
mean_std <- features[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", features[,2]),]
```
We can check the extracted data writing. 

``` R
View(mean_std)
```

#### 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- This script will  name the column of merged y dataset.

``` R
colnames(y_total) <- "activity"
```

- Finally this script give the result as instruction asked.

``` R
y_total$activitylabel <- factor(y_total$activity, labels = as.character(activity_labels[,2]))
activitylabel <- y_total[, -1]
``` 
#### 5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- This script will label the datset with appropriate variable names.

``` R
colnames(X_total) <- features[mean_std[,1],2]
```

####  6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- Following scripts will create the final Tidy Data.

- name "subject"" to sub_total column.

``` R
colnames(sub_total) <- "subject"
```

- Merge datasets

``` R
total <- cbind(X_total, activitylabel, sub_total)
```

- group by activity label and subject %>% summarize by mean.

``` R
total_mean <- total %>%
        group_by(activitylabel, subject) %>%
        summarize_each((funs(mean)))
```

#### Final Step
- write Tidy Data and export `tidydata.txt`.

``` R
write.table(total_mean, file = "tidydata.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names` = TRUE)
```
